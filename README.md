# Hacktoberfest
We at DSC BVP Pune organised this event to spread awareness about the importance of Open Source Development.

## Birds
Birds is the 'Simply Me' template downloaded from W3Schools. The participants were asked to fix the bugs pertaining to the website.

## Folio
Folio is a simple personal mobile app that a user can get up and running. Just update your details and social media links in the ```Folio/lib/main.dart``` file. Then, remove all images from the ```Folio/assets/images/``` folder and add your photograph. Open ```Folio/pubspec.yaml``` and replace ```dewanshrawat15.jpg``` in ```assets/images/dewanshrawat15.jpg``` with the name of your photograph. Update the same in the ```Folio/lib/main.dart``` file and you have a basic mobile app ready.

PS, you will have to update a few files before you are ready to upload it on Play Store or App Store, but that is beyond the scope of this workshop.

## Website
Website is a base template for DSC BVP Pune's website. We added a few base details to it and asked the contributors to add they're images and details on the website.
